# Test Backend

This is the official test backend for OpenSAFELY. It's deployed and managed by
the OpenSAFELY platform team, and is integrated with jobs.opensafely.org.

It uses the dummy expectations backend, and has no actual patient data
involved at all.

Currently it just implements the execution side, there's no output viewing or
publishing workflow.
