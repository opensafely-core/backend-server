This file contains information about the OpenSAFELY Hyper-V Ubuntu VM image.

 * Image is based on the published Ubuntu Server 20.04 cloud image.
 * The sample VM resources are minimal: 1CPU, 1G RAM, 5G disk, we expect these
   to be increased to match the current Docker VM resources when we switch
   over.
 * Configured to download and install security updates daily (will not reboot
   automatically).
 * Only service running is SSH on port 22
    - No host ssh keys are included in the image
    - On first boot, fresh random keys will be generated.
 * It has various user accounts and groups set up for the OpenSAFELY team.
    - Access to these is via SSH
    - Per-user public SSH keys already configured
    - Accounts have no passwords set, and password login is disabled
    - Accounts in the developers group have passwordless sudo access
    - Users will ssh in from git-bash on the Level 3 server, with local SSH keys.
 * There are no secrets or passwords included in the image
 * The OpenSAFELY job-runner service is installed
   - it is not fully configured, as that needs secret information that must be
     supplied post import.
   - it does not listen on any ports, just polls jobs.opensafely.org for new
     jobs.


Network access:

 - Port 22 exposed to VM Host, but not externally.
 - egress to github.com, *.opensafely.org, as currently for host.
 - New egress needed:
